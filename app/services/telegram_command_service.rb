# The TelegramCommandService is responsible for interpreting the command received from the user
# and generating the appropriate response
# This service aims to encapsulate the logic for handling different commands
# (/start, /help, /search, /settings, /language) in a single, reusable component
# Each public method within the service corresponds to a specific command,
# simplifying the command processing workflow within the bot's controllers or other services
